-- explanation:
-- dense_rank is used so duplicate salaries are handled correctly
-- and the second highest salary is returned even if ties exist

select salary
from (
    select salary,
           dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as rnk
    from employee
) t
where rnk = 2;

-- alternate method

select max(salary) as second_highest_salary
from employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from employee);
