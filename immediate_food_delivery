-- explanation:
-- only the first order per customer is considered
-- immediate deliveries are counted using case

select round(
    avg(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end) * 100,
    2
) as immediate_percentage
from (
    select *,
           row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rn
    from delivery
) t
where rn = 1;
