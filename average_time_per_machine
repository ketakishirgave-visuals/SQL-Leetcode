-- explanation:
-- start and end timestamps are extracted using conditional max
-- average processing time is computed per machine

select machine_id,
       round(avg(end_time - start_time), 3) as processing_time
from (
    select machine_id,
           max(case when activity_type = 'start' then timestamp end) as start_time,
           max(case when activity_type = 'end' then timestamp end) as end_time
    from activity
    group by machine_id, process_id
) t
