-- explanation:
-- id minus row_number creates grouping for consecutive rows
-- only groups of length 3 or more are kept

select id,
       visit_date,
       people
from (
    select *,
           count(*) over (partition by id - row_number() over (order by id)) as seq_len
    from stadium
    where people >= 100
) t
where seq_len >= 3;
